# Ed-Fi Technology Roadmap

The [Ed-Fi Technology Roadmap](https://docs.ed-fi.org/reference/roadmap/)
provides information on the development plans and release schedule for all
components of the Ed-Fi Technology Suite.

The releases, feature sets, and dates on the roadmap are plans, not promises.
Organizations desiring to take critical dependencies on roadmap items are
advised to work closely with the Alliance staff.

This repository does not contain code - just the issues that make up the
roadmap. These issues are of two types, each of which has a separate project
board for viewing status by product line:

* [Proposed features](https://github.com/orgs/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/projects/2)
* [Planned releases](https://github.com/orgs/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/projects/1)

At this time, issues are only created by Ed-Fi staff. Please use the [Ed-Fi
Community Hub](https://community.ed-fi.org) to request support or offer ideas
for improvement. Improvement ideas can also come through governance channels
such as the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), various work groups, or special
interest groups (SIGs).

The public is welcome to comment on the issues in either board. Please review
and adhere to the [Ed-Fi Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
before commenting.
